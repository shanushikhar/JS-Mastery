javascript principles => 

Goes through line by line called Thread of Execution
.exceute fn by fn's name & ()
.execution context has Thread of Execution and Memory

Call stack
.js keeps track of fn running i.e. where is T.O.E
.run fn,js add to call stack and removes it once finish running the fn

Higher Order function
.The fn we pass in is a callback fn(mapStateToProps has parameter) as a argument. 
.The outer fn that takes in the function (our callback) is a higher-order function(connect).

.Methods are functions that they can use on themselves
const array = [1,2,3]
array.push(10)
.the arrays i.e [1,2,3] get are stored in an object internally so that
every array has access towhen we refer to that array by 'dot' and Methods like push,map etc, 
.the link to this object full of shared methods is on the __proto__ property.
